            <p id="b">In common usage, climate change describes global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its effects on Earth's climate system.
                <br>
                Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate.
                <br>
                The current rise in global average temperature is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution.
                <br>
                Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices add to greenhouse gases.
                <br>
                 These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere.
                 <br>
                Carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas driving global warming, has grown by about 50% and is at levels unseen for millions of years.</p>

                <p id="c">Climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment.
                    <br>
                     Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.
                     <br>
                      Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline.
                      <br>
                       Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.
                       <br>
                        Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.
                        <br>
                         Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries.
                         <br>
                     These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.</p>
                     <p id="d">
                        Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss.
                        <br>
                         Human migration and conflict can also be a result.
                         <br>
                          The World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century.
                          <br>
                          Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming.
                          <br>
                           Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached.
                           <br>
                         Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.
