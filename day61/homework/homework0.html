            <p class="green">Definitions of sports cars often relate to how the car design is optimised for dynamic performance,
                <br>
                 without any specific minimum requirements; both a Triumph Spitfire and Ferrari 488 Pista can be considered sports cars,
                 <br>
                  despite vastly different levels of performance. Broader definitions of sports cars include cars "in which performance takes precedence over carrying capacity",
                  <br>
                   or that emphasise the "thrill of driving" or are marketed "using the excitement of speed and the glamour of the (race)track" However, other people have more specific definitions,
                   <br>
                 such as "must be a two-seater or a 2+2 seater" or a car with two seats only.</p>
