                <p style="color: green;">Black holes are some of the strangest and most fascinating objects in space. They're extremely dense, with such strong gravitational attraction that not even light can escape their grasp. 
                <br>
                The Milky Way could contain over 100 million black holes, though detecting these gluttonous beasts is very difficult.
                <br>
                 At the heart of the Milky Way lies a supermassive black hole — Sagittarius A*.
                 <br>
                 The colossal structure is about 4 million times the mass of the sun and lies approximately 26,000 light-years away from Earth, according to a statement from NASA.
                 <br>
                The first image of a black hole was captured in 2019 by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration.
                <br>
                 The striking photo of the black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy 55 million light-years from Earth thrilled scientists around the world.
                 <br>
                 They're huge concentrations of matter packed into very tiny spaces.
                 <br>
                  A black hole is so dense that gravity just beneath its surface, the event horizon, is strong enough that nothing not even light can escape.
                  <br>
                  The event horizon isn't a surface like Earth's or even the Sun's.
