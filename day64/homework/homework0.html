            <p id="one">The English word <i>bear</i> comes from Old English bera and belongs to a family of names for the bear in Germanic languages, such as Swedish bj√∂rn, also used as a first name.
                <br>
                 This form is conventionally said to be related to a Proto-Indo-European word for <i>brown</i>, so that <i>bear</i> would mean <i>the brown one</i>.</p>

                <br>
                 There are eight species: Asiatic black bears <b>also called moon bears</b>, brown bears <b>which include grizzly bears</b>, giant pandas, North American black bears, polar bears, sloth bears, spectacled bears <b>also called Andean bears</b>, and sun bears.</p>

                <p id="tow">On average, bears can live up to 25 years in the wild and 50 in captivity.
                    <br>
                     Six species, including the polar bear and the giant panda,

                <p id="thre">During winter, when food is scarce, most bears have an effective survival solution: hibernation,
                    <br>
                     a physical state in which the heart rate, body temperature, metabolism, and respiration is lowered.
                    <br>
                     Grizzly and black bears can go for 100 days or so without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating.
                     <br>
                      They live off a layer of fat that they build up during the summer and fall.</p>
