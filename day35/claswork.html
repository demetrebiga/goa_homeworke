            <h2>iformation about black holes</h2>
            <p>They're huge concentrations of matter packed into very tiny spaces.
                A black hole is so dense that gravity just beneath its surface, the event horizon, <br>
                 is strong enough that nothing not even light can escape <br>
                The event horizon isn't a surface like Earth's or even the Sun's.</p>
